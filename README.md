📈 Demand Forecasting for E-commerce and Retail

This project aims to build accurate and scalable demand forecasting models for e-commerce and retail businesses. By leveraging historical sales data, product metadata, and external factors, the models help predict future product demand to optimize inventory management, supply chain operations, and marketing strategies.
🚀 Project Objectives

    Forecast daily/weekly/monthly demand at product or category level.

    Reduce overstock and stockouts through predictive analytics.

    Support real-time and batch processing of demand forecasts.

    Provide visual insights for business decision-making.

📦 Key Features

    🧠 Machine Learning Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest)

    📊 Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc.)

    🗃️ Feature Engineering (calendar events, lag variables, promotional flags)

    📈 Model Evaluation (MAPE, RMSE, SMAPE)

    🌐 Interactive Dashboards (optional via Streamlit or PowerBI)

    ⏱️ Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization

📊 Example Use Cases

    Forecasting daily demand for SKUs in an online retail store.

    Predicting weekly sales across regions for a supermarket chain.

    Planning stock levels for promotional campaigns (e.g., Black Friday).

📈 Sample Workflow

    Data Collection: Load historical sales and product data.

    Preprocessing: Clean, impute, and transform data.

    Feature Engineering: Create lag features, rolling averages, etc.

    Model Training: Train models and evaluate performance.

    Forecasting: Generate future demand predictions.

    Visualization: Analyze forecasts via plots or dashboards.
